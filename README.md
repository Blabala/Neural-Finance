They are all html files, please remember to download it and open it with browser. Most part of this document is writen in English, but due to the reference written in Chinese tier-1 company, some part was writen in Chinese. If the descriptions written in Chinses, I will write a sentence in English to describe it. 

<br/>

1.Basic usage about tensorflow, if you are familar with it, you can skip it.

2.Fully-connected-layer, usage and its application in finance.

3.Recurrent-neural-network, usage and its application in finance.

4.Convoluntional-neural-network, usage and its application in finance.

**I am pennultimate graduate student in Tsinghua University, have training both in CS department's and Business school's quantitative lab. I really hope that we can be the state of the art in neural finance. (deep learning + finance)**

**If you are intrested in my work and interested in AI and Quant, please follow me and give me a star. I will update my work if I have time, opportunity. And the most important part is that many of my work can't be shared, I have signed Non-Disclosure Agreement to some tier1 company. For some work, if I have the right, I will upload them.**

**But the disappointmenting thing is that, I have to sign NDA (non-disclosure agreement) in my latest two internships, nothing have been updated since the late 2019, sorry for that**
