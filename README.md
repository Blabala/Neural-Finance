**I am pennultimate graduate student in Tsinghua University, have training both in CS department's and Business school's quantitative lab. I really hope that we can be the state of the art in neural finance. (deep learning + finance)**

**Due to the academic innovation and alpha decay, I can't show more details about the experiments. If you have same interests and want to know more about the details, please feel free to contact me.**
