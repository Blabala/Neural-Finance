They are all html files, please remember to download it and open it with browser. Most part of this document is writen in English, but due to the reference written in Chinese tier-1 company, some part was writen in Chinese. If the descriptions written in Chinses, I will write a sentence in English to describe it. **There are 4 html files, you can have a look at the Overview Part. If you have interests, then you can git clone this project. There are four html files which will give you detailed introduction.**

If you are intrested in my work and interested in AI and Quant, please follow me and give me a star. I will update my work if I have time, opportunity. And the most important part is that many of my work can't be shared, I have signed Non-Disclosure Agreement to some tier1 company. For some work, if I have the right, I will upload them.

**But the disappointmenting thing is that, I have to sign strict NDA (non-disclosure agreement) in my latest two internships, nothing have been updated since the late 2019, sorry for that....**
