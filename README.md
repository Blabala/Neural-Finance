They are all html files, please remember to download it and open it with browser. Most part of this document is writen in English, but due to the reference written in Chises tier-1 company, some part was writen in Chinese. If the descriptions written in Chinses, I will write a sentence in English to describe it.

1.Basic usage about tensorflow, if you are familar with it, you can skip it.

2.Fully-connected-layer, usage and its application in finance.


3.Recurrent-neural-network, usage and its application in finance.

4.Convoluntional-neural-network, usage and its application in finance.

**I am pennultimate graduate student in Tsinghua University, have training both in CS department's and Business school's quantitative lab. I really hope that we can be the state of the art in neural finance. (deep learning + finance)**

**Due to the academic innovation and alpha decay, I can't show more details about the experiments. If you have same interests and want to know more about the details, please feel free to contact me.**
